# Hack the _conservative_ in Media

A guideline for literacy on the conservative media. 

### General Observations
_There is much more in history, scientific evidence, individual experiences and underlying dogmas in common sense to consider a multi-edged opinion opposed to what conservative news agencies present as facts or even as science, what they on purpose do not uncover and how the apparent pluralistic dualtity between mainstream and alternative news only leads to less understanding through more noise._

#### Background
- The hyperreal and the fiction of our reality matrix opposed to historical facts, scientific evidence and the real

  _The conservative reporting about certain important events and apparently less important facts leads to a one-sided public opinion. Together with the overload of information, leading to an inevitable noise, most man can only attend to the financial benefits and future insurance policies for themselfs and their immediate environment and therefor do not oppose the status quo. And without any resistance we automatically maintain, subscribe, proclaim and fool ourselves into living delusions._
  
  - George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, Jean Baudrillard, Umberto Eco

- Health issues related to modern technologies, modern medicine, food and polution (including weather modification)

  _Human health, brainpower, thoughts and consciousness are under pressure by modern technologies, healthcare, medicine and marketing strategies. It becomes harder and harder each day to separate facts from fiction, to feel healthy and to know yourself._
  
  - (scientific research on wifi, g4 and g5 radiation) - possibly causing cancer as stated by among others. the european commission
  - scientific research on comparative radiation, waves and frequencies that break down the resistance system
    

- Public relations and false flags - new funded terrorism

  _The ridiculing of conspiracies by conservative media agencies are in in contradiction with the long human history of proven conspiracies and the ease with which people are repeatedly misled. Eventually this will only lead to media and persons ridiculing themselfs and distrust themselfs._
  
  - Freud, Barney, Sartre, Nietsche 
  - the acceptance of ai robotics, cyborg lifeforms and technological infiltration disguished in gender neutral politics
  - weather modification without public consent - overshadowed by the climate change politics
