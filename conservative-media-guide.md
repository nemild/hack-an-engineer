# Hack the _conservative_ in Media

An alternative media literacy guide for open-minded people

### General Observations
_There is a great deal of documented history, scientific research, individual experiences and underlying dogmas in common sense to consider a multifaceted opinion and come to a deeper understanding, as opposed to what press agencies present as facts or science, which information they purposely do not reveal and how the apparent pluralistic duality between regular and alternative news only produces more noise and leads to less understanding of the matter through disorientation and distraction._

### Definition

The current conservative media is defined by financial and political motives that stem from capitalism. For legal investments with a profit motive in money, entities depend on the monetary system. The monetary system is globally dependent on the central banks through the perpetual debt agreements with the local governments. This interaction of dependence puts enormous pressure on the monetary and socio-economic policies of all entities to maintain this economic system, modern capitalism. This means that all media that depend on investors with a profit motive in money are by definition conservative.

### Key Tips

  - Conservative media is not the so called Main Stream Media and is not defined by the technology that they use as a medium. The conservative media is a type of well established media and has overcome the shift from old media technologies to the internet very well, not limited to newspapers and television news channels. 
  - The conservative media are widely represented and cited. They indirectly, and sometimes unintentionally, represent the most powerful entities on earth.
  - Apparent conflicts and opposite opinions from different conservative media channels, apparently mainstream and alternative, can basically use the same sources and / or pursue the same motives.

### Recognition points
 
  - initially only seemingly to report events
  - in the second instance, 'well-prepared' 'experts' and witnesses are questioned
  - one-sidedness; the same topics and views are extensively repeated 
  - are often the mouthpiece of the local government
  - no attention for suspicions against governments
  - no attention for and denial of various proven conspiracies
  - use quasi-scientific explanations, backed by 'well-prepared experts' as scientific evidence
  - always have the same sources including the local state newsoffice, Reuters, Wegener and Nasa.
  - no attention for clear controversial world issues.
  - no attention for debate about changes to the central banking system or the perpetual debt agreements
  

### Philosophical background

- The hyperreal and the fiction of the human reality matrix opposed to historical facts, scientific evidence and the real

  _The onesided conservative coverage of certain important events and apparently less important facts leads to a one-sided public opinion. In conjuction with the overload of information, accelerated by our digital technologies, including all the apparent pluralistic duality between regular and alternative news, leading to an inevitable noise, most man can only attend to the benefits of financial security, status, contentment for themselfs and their immediate environment and therefor can not affort to oppose the status quo. And without this resistance we automatically maintain, subscribe, proclaim and fool ourselves into living delusions._

  - Plato, George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, Paul Virilio, Jean Baudrillard, Umberto Eco
  
  Plato discussed the 'ideal forms' of which our perception of reality was an approximation. In hyperreality, it is assumed that our approaches become detached from ideal forms, leaving our perceptions of reality based on other approaches, without the ability to restore the original true form.
  The most important notice about our Hyper-reality is the possibility of losing sight of the horizon of reality in a world intertwined with so many signs that only refer to concepts anchored in a virtual world and offered to us 24/7 in real time.

### Examples

  #### Hyperreal contradictions 
 
  The conservative media only repeat the scientific consensus
  - In our Hyperreality the originality of scientific research should be questioned (politics vs science)
  
    #### _the climate change scientific consensus is in fact a religion based on political incentives_

    - [CNN Slammed by John Coleman over Climate Change FRAUD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=YQshyqCLYHo)
    
  - Overshadowed by apparent more important topics (like the climate change debate) Man cannot or will not see exactly what is happening above his head. The Orwellian words 'thought crime' and 'crime stop' describe the concept of not being able to, and even intrinsically compulsive stop to think about certain subjects.

- Health issues related to modern technologies, modern medicine, food and polution (including weather modification)

  _Human health, brainpower and consciousness are under pressure by modern technologies, environmental pollution, bad healthcare, insidious pharmaceuticals and the programming of society itself depending on marketing strategies. It becomes harder and harder each day to separate facts from fiction, to feel healthy and to know thou self._
  
  - (scientific research on wifi, g4 and g5 radiation) - possibly causing cancer as stated by among others. the european commission
  - scientific research on comparative radiation, waves and frequencies that break down the resistance system
    

- Public relations and false flags - new funded terrorism

  _The ridiculing of conspiracies by conservative media agencies are in contradiction with the long human history of proven conspiracies and the ease with which people are repeatedly misled. Eventually this will only lead to media and persons ridiculing themselfs and distrust themselfs._
